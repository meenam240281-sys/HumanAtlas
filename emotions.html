            <h3>A Note on Emotional Language</h3>
            <p>
                Words for emotions are approximations. They attempt to capture internal states that are often 
                complex, layered, and contradictory. This dictionary seeks not to define absolutely, but to 
                describe with nuance—acknowledging that what one person calls "sadness" might contain elements 
                of relief, nostalgia, or peaceful acceptance.
            </p>
            <p>
                Cultural context, personal history, and physiological state all shape how emotions are experienced 
                and labeled. These entries are starting points for reflection, not final definitions.
