            <h2>Purpose</h2>
            <p>
                HumanAtlas.world exists to map the shared terrain of human experience—not to give advice, 
                not to fix problems, but to describe the landscape we all navigate. In a world that often 
                emphasizes our differences, this project quietly documents our common ground.
            </p>
            <p>
                The goal is recognition, not instruction. When you read about an experience here, you might 
                think, "Yes, I know that feeling," or "I've seen that in someone I love." That moment of 
                recognition is the purpose: the quiet understanding that in our most human moments, we are 
                not alone.

                    <h3>Descriptive, Not Prescriptive</h3>
                    <p>
                        We describe experiences as they are, not as they should be. There is no "right" way 
                        to feel lonely or to experience failure. There are only the ways humans actually do.

                    <h3>Universal, Not Uniform</h3>
                    <p>
                        While experiences are universal, their expression is infinitely varied. The same 
                        emotion might be shouted in one culture and carried in silence in another. Both are 
                        equally human.

                    <p>
                        The experiences documented here have been part of human life for centuries and will 
                        remain so. This is not about current events or passing concerns, but about what 
                        persists across generations.

                        This atlas attempts to speak across differences of age, culture, and circumstance. 
                        When it falls short, that failure itself becomes data about the limits of any single 
                        perspective.

            <h2>Why Timeless Design?</h2>
            <p>
                HumanAtlas.world is designed to remain relevant and usable for decades. This means:
            </p>
            <ul class="timeless-list">
                <li><strong>No dependencies:</strong> No APIs, databases, or external services that might disappear</li>
                <li><strong>No accounts:</strong> Nothing to log into, nothing to maintain</li>
                <li><strong>Static architecture:</strong> Plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that will work in any browser</li>
                <li><strong>Classic typography:</strong> Fonts chosen for readability across devices and time</li>
                <li><strong>Subtle aesthetics:</strong> Colors and layouts that don't date quickly</li>
                <li><strong>Evergreen content:</strong> Topics that matter as much in 20 years as they do today</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The internet is filled with temporary things. This aims to be permanent—a digital monument 
                to shared human experience that remains standing as technologies come and go.
