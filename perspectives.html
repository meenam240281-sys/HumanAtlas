                The same experience—failure, love, loss, hope—lands differently depending on where we stand 
                in our lives. This is not about which perspective is "right," but about understanding how 
                time reshapes meaning.

                    The world is immediate, sensory, and defined by clear boundaries. Time stretches and compresses 
                    in unfamiliar ways—an hour can feel like a day, a summer like a lifetime. Relationships are 
                    understood in concrete terms: who is kind, who plays fair, who listens.
                </p>

                    <div class="example">
                        <h4>First Failure</h4>
                        <p>Often experienced as a global statement about ability rather than a specific outcome. "I failed at this" easily becomes "I am a failure." The emotion is raw and undiluted by perspective.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="example">
                        <h4>Loneliness</h4>
                        <p>A physical feeling of emptiness. Often expressed through behavior rather than words—clinginess, withdrawal, or creating imaginary companions. The concept of "temporary" is difficult to grasp.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="example">
                        <h4>Hope</h4>
                        <p>Often tied to specific, tangible outcomes: a toy, a visit, a birthday. The timeline is short, the expectations concrete. Disappointment is acute but often quickly replaced by new hope.</p>

                <p class="perspective-description">
                    Identity formation becomes central. The social world expands dramatically, bringing both connection 
                    and comparison. Emotions are intense, often feeling permanent in the moment. The future begins 
                    to take shape as both promise and pressure.

                        <h4>First Failure</h4>
                        <p>Often intertwined with identity and social standing. A failure can feel like it defines who you are in the eyes of peers. The stakes feel existential.</p>

                        <h4>Loneliness</h4>
                        <p>Particularly painful amidst social abundance—feeling alone in a crowd, misunderstood by family, or different from peers. Can drive both conformity and rebellion.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="example">
                        <h4>Hope</h4>
                        <p>Often directed toward future independence, self-definition, and escape from current constraints. Can be both exhilarating and terrifying in its openness.</p>

                    The weight of responsibility increases alongside freedom. Life paths diverge. Comparison with peers 
                    becomes more nuanced—careers, relationships, life choices. The tension between ambition and contentment 
                    often emerges.

                        <p>Now has practical consequences—career setbacks, relationship endings. The learning from failure becomes more deliberate, though no less painful.</p>

                    <div class="example">
                        <h4>Loneliness</h4>
                        <p>Can emerge amidst busyness and achievement. The loneliness of not having found "your people" or "your path." Sometimes a loneliness of authenticity—showing your true self and finding few who understand.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="example">
                        <h4>Hope</h4>
                        <p>Often project-oriented: hope for career success, for finding a partner, for establishing a home. The timeline extends but remains relatively near.</p>

                <p class="perspective-description">
                    Reflection on paths taken and not taken. Awareness of time's passage becomes more acute. Responsibilities 
                    often peak—children, aging parents, career demands. The question "What have I accomplished?" gains weight.
                </p>

                    <div class="example">
                        <h4>Loneliness</h4>
                        <p>Can emerge from changing family structures, friendships that have drifted, or the sense of being misunderstood in long-term relationships. Sometimes a loneliness of responsibility—carrying burdens others don't see.</p>

                <p class="perspective-description">
                    The arc of a life becomes visible in retrospect. Time becomes both precious and expansive. Relationships 
                    with younger generations often bring both joy and the poignancy of watching time cycle. The focus often 
                    shifts from achievement to meaning, from accumulation to essence.

                    <div class="example">
                        <h4>Loneliness</h4>
                        <p>Often accompanies loss—of peers, of partners, of physical capacity. Can be mixed with appreciation for solitude and the richness of memory. Sometimes a loneliness of being a living archive in a changing world.</p>

                    <div class="example">
