            <p>
                Culture provides the language, rituals, and expectations through which we interpret our experiences. 
                These lenses don't change the fundamental human experiences, but they shape how they are expressed, 
                understood, and valued.
            </p>
            <p class="note">
                Note: These are broad patterns, not stereotypes. Individual experience always varies.

                <p class="culture-description">
                    High density, anonymity amidst crowds, exposure to diversity, pace as a constant. 
                    The self is often defined in relation to choice and mobility rather than fixed location.

                        <h5>Loneliness</h5>
                        <p>Can occur in physical proximity to thousands. The paradox of connection—endless opportunities for contact alongside profound isolation. Often addressed through curated communities rather than geography.</p>

                        <h5>Success</h5>
                        <p>Often measured in career achievement, network size, or cultural capital. Visibility matters. Quiet successes may go unnoticed unless made public.</p>

                        <p>Often chosen rather than given—friends as family, interest-based groups. Boundaries between personal and public space are carefully managed.</p>

                    Connection to land and seasons, visibility within community, interdependence as practical reality. 
                    Identity often tied to place, family history, and traditional knowledge.

            <h3>On Cultural Fluidity</h3>
            <p>
                Most people navigate multiple cultural contexts—moving between work and home cultures, 
                between heritage and chosen communities. This creates hybrid perspectives that draw from 
                multiple traditions. The human capacity to adapt and integrate different cultural lenses 
                is itself a universal experience.
